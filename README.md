</p>

Exploring the evolution of LEGO's brick diversity over time, this analysis willinvestigates how the variety of bricks has transformed. Since its inception in the early 1950s, LEGO has not only expanded the quantity of sets introduced annually but has also elevated the intricacy and diversity of colors, parts, and themes concurrently

The dataset contains the LEGO parts, sets, colors, and Inventories of every official LEGO set in the rebuildable database. These files are current as of July 2017. This dataset was compiled by Rebrickable, which is a website to help identify what LEGO sets can be built given bricks and pieces from other LEGO sets.
